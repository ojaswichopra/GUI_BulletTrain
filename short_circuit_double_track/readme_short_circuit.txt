step 1 -> open the file name "short_circuit_studies_for_user_input.m" .
step 2 -> run "short_circuit_studies_for_user_input.m" file on GNU OCTAVE or MATLAB.  
 
note 1: .
note 2: 
note 3: it will ask for "Enter the time instant (sec) for short circuit" user need to enter the time instant of short circuit in sec.
note 4: next "Enter the distance from starting point for voltage profile of entire day in kM" user has to enter the location of short circuit.
note 5: next "Enter the code for the "type of fault" as 1 - CR fault 2 -RF fault 3 - CF fault 4 - CRF fault" user needs to enter the fault type in the given code i.e - 
		fault code :: fault type
			1 - CR fault
			2 - RF fault
			3 - CF fault
			4 - CRF fault
note 6: "Enter the fault resistance in ohm"



note 7: To get the plot for line current and contact voltages with respect to distance for up and down track run "Full_track_up_Current_voltage_profile_short_circuit_load_txt" and Full_track_down_Current_voltage_profile_short_circuit_load_txt.
