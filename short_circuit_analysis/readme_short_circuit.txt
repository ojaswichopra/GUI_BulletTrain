step 1 -> open the file name "short_circuit_studies_for_user_input.m" .
step 2 -> run "short_circuit_studies_for_user_input.m" file on GNU OCTAVE or MATLAB.  
 
note 1: it will ask for "the no. of trains running per hour" is the frequency of train per hour, user need to feed and integer no 1 to n.
note 2: it will ask for "number of hours of train scheduling per day" user need to feed the total time user want to run trains in the track
note 3: it will ask for "Enter the time instant (sec) for short circuit" user need to enter the time instant of short circuit in sec.
note 4: next "Enter the distance from starting point for voltage profile of entire day in kM" user has to enter the location of short circuit.
note 5: next "Enter the code for the "type of fault" as 1 - CR fault 2 -RF fault 3 - CF fault 4 - CRF fault" user needs to enter the fault type in the given code i.e - 
		fault code :: fault type
			1 - CR fault
			2 - RF fault
			3 - CF fault
			4 - CRF fault
note 6: "Enter the fault resistance in ohm"

note 7: after completion of procees window for line current and contact voltages with respect to distance will be plot.
